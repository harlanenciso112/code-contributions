### 1. Keep the tutorial short

I think this is one of the most important aspects that helped this project grow. Getting a pay-off within five minutes of learning something is remarkable. For brevity, we have to compromise on details. A lot of details are missing from the main tutorial. From explanations on what actually happens when you run those commands to other good practices one could follow. 

### 2. Accessibility matters

We want these tutorials to be accessible to as much people as possible. Be it somebody having trouble with language barriers or someone with limited internet speed. Translations help people understand this in languages they're more comfortable with. Keeping the size of this repository small will help with limited bandwidth.
If we see that the web page takes a lot of time to load on computers that doesn't have much processing power or memory, we'll remove contributor HTML files to improve that situation

### 3. Users shouldn't have to install (almost) anything.

We're going on the assumption that most user will have a web browser, text editor and terminal emulator. We want users to be able to go though the tutorial with these.
We don't want user to install node or python to run a web server on local. 


### 4. Be generic.

We could make assumptions about what OS most of our users are using or what terminal emulator or text editor they're comfortable with. By not making such assumptions, we give our readers more freedom and include more people.



Feel free to challenge any of the above in issues. I'd love to get feedback from you. Let's have a discussion.
